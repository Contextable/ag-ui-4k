## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher (JDK 17 recommended)
- Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA
- Kotlin 2.1.21 or higher (with K2 compiler)
- Gradle 8.5 or higher

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/contextable/ag-ui-4k.git
cd ag-ui-4k

# Navigate to the library directory
cd library

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific platform tests
./gradlew androidTest
./gradlew iosSimulatorArm64Test
./gradlew jvmTest
```

### Code Style

We follow the official [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html). Key points:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer immutability (`val` over `var`)

### Project Structure

- Main library code is in `library/src/`
- Platform-specific code goes in appropriate source sets (e.g., `library/src/androidMain/`)
- Tests go in `library/src/commonTest/` or platform-specific test directories

### Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use mocks for external dependencies

Example test structure:
```kotlin
@Test
fun `should handle event when condition is met`() {
    // Given
    val agent = TestAgent()
    
    // When
    val result = agent.processEvent(event)
    
    // Then
    assertEquals(expected, result)
}
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs
- Include code examples in documentation
- Update the changelog for significant changes

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Android
- Minimum SDK: 21
- Target latest stable Android version
- Test on both emulators and real devices

### iOS
- Minimum iOS version: 13.0
- Test on both simulators and real devices
- Ensure compatibility with both Intel and Apple Silicon

### JVM
- Target Java 11 compatibility
- Test on multiple JVM implementations if possible

## Release Process

1. Update version in `build.gradle.kts`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release branch
4. Run full test suite
5. Create a pull request
6. After merge, tag the release
7. Publish to Maven Central
